# Invite to Team

Inviting users to your team allows you to collaborate on projects, share resources, and manage access permissions collectively. This guide will walk you through the step-by-step process of inviting new team members using the NikaPlanet interface.

## Overview

Team invitations enable you to:
- Add new collaborators to your workspace
- Assign appropriate permission levels
- Manage team access centrally
- Streamline collaboration workflows

## How to Invite Users to Your Team

### Step 1: Navigate to Settings

From your main workspace view, click on **Settings** in the left navigation sidebar.

### Step 3: Invite New Members

On the Members page, you'll see a list of current team members. To add someone new, click the **"Invite people"** button below the member list.

### Step 4: Send Invitation

A dialog will open where you can enter the email address of the person you want to invite. Enter their email and click **"Send request"** to send the invitation.

## What Happens Next

### Invitation Sent

Once you send the invitation:
- The new member will appear in your Members list with a "Pending" status
- An email invitation will be sent to the invitee's email address
- The invitation will expire in 7 days if not accepted

### Invitee Receives Email

The person you invited will receive an email that looks like this:

![Email invitation received](/guides/access-control/invite-to-workspace-6.jpg)

The email contains:
- A personalized invitation message
- A **"Join Team"** button to accept the invitation
- Information about the team they're being invited to join
- Expiration details (7 days)

### Invitation Acceptance

When the invitee clicks the **"Join Team"** button in their email:
- They'll be redirected to create or sign into their NikaPlanet account
- Once accepted, their status will change from "Pending" to "Active" in your Members list
- They'll have immediate access to the team resources based on their assigned role

## Managing Team Members

### Current Members

Your Members page shows all team members with their:
- Email address
- Username
- Role (Owner, Member, etc.)
- Actions available (delete, change role, etc.)

### Pending Invitations

Track the status of sent invitations:
- **Pending**: Invitation sent but not yet accepted
- **Active**: User has joined the team
- **Expired**: Invitation has expired and needs to be resent

### Resending Invitations

If an invitation expires or the user doesn't respond, you can resend the invitation from the Members management interface.

## Permission Levels

Team members typically have these access levels:

- **Owner**: Full access to team settings and member management
- **Member**: Can access team resources and collaborate on projects
- **Custom**: Tailored permissions based on specific needs only for **Enterprise License** users

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Communication**: The invitation email automatically includes context about your team
2. **Appropriate Permissions**: Start with standard member access and adjust as needed
3. **Regular Review**: Periodically review team member access and permissions
4. **Follow Up**: Check with invitees if they haven't accepted within a few days

## Workspace Access and Team Permissions

### Creating Workspaces Under Teams

When you create a new workspace using the "Create New Workspace" dialog, it will automatically be associated with the selected team and default to giving **"Can edit"** access to all team members.

**Before Creation**: You can configure the default team access level:
- **Can edit**: Team members can modify and manage the workspace
- **Can comment**: Team members can view and add comments
- **Can view**: Team members have read-only access
- **Not shared**: Other members of the team will not be able to access this workspace

### Managing Workspace Access After Creation

Once a workspace is created, you can modify team access permissions by:

1. **Opening the Share Dialog**: Click the share button in the top right corner of any workspace
2. **Accessing "People with access"**: Navigate to the "People with access" section
3. **Modifying Team Permissions**: Change the access level for "Nika's Team" or individual team members

![Share dialog with team access management](/guides/access-control/invite-to-team-4.jpg)

**Available Permission Levels**:
- **Can edit**: Full editing and management capabilities
- **Can comment**: Ability to view and add comments
- **Can view**: Read-only access to workspace content
- **Not shared**: No access to the workspace

**Additional Options**:
- **Send invite email**: Automatically notify team members of access changes
- **Individual member management**: Set different permissions for specific team members vs. the entire team

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Invitation Not Received**: Ask the invitee to check their spam/junk folder
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure the user has the correct role assignments
- **Team Access**: Verify the user is assigned to the correct team(s)
