## Set Initial View

Save your current map view (zoom level and center position) so that whenever the map is reopened, it starts from that exact view state.

## How to Set Initial View

### Save Current View
1. **Navigate to your desired view** - pan and zoom to the perfect position
2. **Click the "Save Initial View" button** in the top toolbar
3. **View is now saved** - the map will open to this view every time

### What Gets Saved
- **Center position** - the geographic center of the map
- **Zoom level** - how close or far the view is
- **Current view state** - exactly as you see it now

### Update Initial View
- **Navigate to a new view** and click the save button again
- **Previous view is replaced** with the new one
- **All future opens** will use the updated view

## Use Cases

- **Focus on important data** - center on your key analysis area
- **Professional presentation** - ensure others see the right view first
- **Consistent experience** - everyone opens to the same view
- **Save time** - no need to navigate to the right view each time

## Next Steps
