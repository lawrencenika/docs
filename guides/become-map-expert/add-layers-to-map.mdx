## Add Layers to Map

Learn how to add data layers to your NikaMap using multiple methods. You can drag files from the Files panel, upload from your desktop, or use the right-click context menu.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Data

Before adding layers, make sure your data is ready:

### Supported File Formats

#### Vector Data Formats
- **Shapefile Components**: .shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj, .cpg, .fix, .sbn, .sbx, .fbn, .fbx, .ain, .aih, .atx, .qix, .qmd
- **GeoPackage**: .gpkg (modern, efficient vector format)
- **FlatGeobuf**: .fgb (fast, compressed vector format)
- **GeoJSON**: .geojson, .json (web-friendly vector format)
- **KML/KMZ**: .kml, .kmz (Google Earth format)
- **GML**: .gml (Geography Markup Language)
- **GeoParquet**: .gpq, .parquet, .geoparquet (columnar format)
- **CSV**: .csv (with coordinate columns)
- **Parquet**: .parquet (efficient columnar storage)
- **GeoParquet**: .geoparquet (spatial extension of Parquet)

#### Raster Data Formats
- **GeoTIFF**: .tif, .tiff, .TIF, .TIFF (high-quality raster format)
- **JPEG**: .jpg, .jpeg, .JPG, .JPEG (compressed image format)

### File Requirements
- **Size Limits**: Files up to several GBs for raster and up to 500 MBs for vector are supported
- **Coordinate System**: Data should have proper spatial reference that can be converted to ESPG:3857 Mercator that NikaMap uses
- **File Structure**: Ensure files are not corrupted or lack of georeferencing (i.e. no lon lat coordinates at all)

## Step 2: Upload Files to Your Opened NikaMap

### Method 1: Upload via Existing Files in NikaWorkspace
1. **Open Files Panel**: Click "Files" in the left sidebar
2. **Multiselect Files**: Hold Shift/Cmd/Ctrl on your keyboard while selecting multiple files
3. **Right Click**: Right click on one of the selections and click Add to Map with the correct destination map selected
4. **Wait for Processing**: Files will be processed before adding to the map automatically. Larger files will take longer to come back because of network transimission despite encrypted

### Method 2: Drag and Drop Files from NikaWorkspace
Same as **Method 1**, just via dragging

**Note**: Make sure you drop to the centered section of the map, if not it will be treated as opening it as a text file

### Method 3: Drag from Desktop
1. **Drag Files**: Drag files directly from your desktop to the map
2. **Auto-upload**: Files will be uploaded and preprocessed before adding to the map automatically

![Drag from Desktop](/guides/become-map-expert/add-layers-to-map-3.gif)

### Method 4: Choose Desktop Files Using Upload Button
1. **Click Upload**: Left-click on Upload button from NikaMap's top bar
2. **Select Files**: Choose the relevant files from your local file system to upload as layers

## Step 3 Context Menu Options
- **Add to Current Map**: Add to the currently active map
- **Add to Specific Map**: Choose from a list of your maps
- **Add as New Layer**: Create a new layer (default behavior)
- **Replace Existing**: Replace an existing layer with the same name

## Step 4: Layer Reordering

### Sort Added Layers
1. **Layers Panel**: Look for the layers panel on the left side. If you dont see it, make sure a map panel is selected in the middle with left sidebar opening for list of maps
2. **Layer List**: All added layers will appear in the list at bottom left
3. **Layer Reordering**: Drag and drop a layer to make them appear on top or below. The ones at bottom will show up on top in the map

## Step 5: Layer Attribute Table

### View Layer Properties
1. **Right-click Layer**: Right-click on a vector layer to open `attributes` in a table format
2. **Select features**: As each row of entry in the table represents one geometry feature on map, selecting it in table will also select it on map
3. **Update Information**: Data field update in the table will immediately be saved as well, just like the geometry features on map

### Layer Controls
- **Visibility Toggle**: Click the eye icon on a single layer to show/hide layers
- **Group Visibility**: Click the same eye icon on a group of layer with folder icon to show/hide all descendent layers
- **Layer Properties**: Right-click on a layer to access styling options
- **Vector Functions**: Right-click on a vector layer to access function options
- **Delete Layer/Group**: Right-click on a layer or group node to delete them instantly from the map

## Step 6: Customize Layer Appearance

### Access Layer Styling
1. **Raster Layer**: Go to [Vector Layer Stylings](/guides/become-map-expert/vector-styling) to view all styles currently supported
2. **Vector Layer**: Go to [Raster Layer Stylings](/guides/become-map-expert/raster-styling) to view all visualizations currently supported

## Step 7: Export Layers from Map

### Different Export options
1. **Single Vector Layer**: Right-click to export as GeoJson from map. Choose whether to desktop or to NikaWorkspace file storage
2. **Group of Layers**: Right-click to export as GeoPackage from map. Choose whether to desktop or to NikaWorkspace file storage

## Step 8: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Layer Not Appearing
- **Check Visibility**: Ensure the layer is visible (eye icon)
- **Zoom to Layer**: Double-click to zoom to layer from the layer list at bottom left
- **Coordinate System**: Verify the data has proper spatial reference
- **File Format**: Confirm the file format is supported and its layer appears in the layer list at bottom left after dragged to map

### Performance Issues
- **Large Files**: Consider simplifying large datasets
- **Too Many Layers**: Remove unnecessary layers
- **Browser Cache**: Refresh the page if needed
- **Network**: Check your internet connection

### Styling Problems
- **Reset Styling**: Use the reset button in styling panel
- **Default Colors**: Apply default color schemes
- **Layer Order**: Ensure layers are in the correct order

## Tips and Best Practices

### Layer Management
- **Logical Ordering**: Arrange layers in logical order (background to foreground)
- **Naming Convention**: Use consistent naming for layers
- **Grouping**: Consider grouping related layers
- **Cleanup**: Remove unused layers regularly

### Performance Optimization
- **File Size**: Keep individual files under reasonable size limits
- **Simplification**: Simplify complex geometries when possible
- **Caching**: Allow time for layers to cache properly
- **Browser**: Use a modern browser for best performance
