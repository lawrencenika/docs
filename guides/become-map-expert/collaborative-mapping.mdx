## Work with Others on the Same Map

NikaMap natively supports multi-user editing and auto-saving, allowing your team to work together on the same map in real-time. Changes are synced to other users with low latency, and the system prevents race conditions by blocking layers when they're being edited.

## Step 1: Understanding Collaborative Mapping

### What is Collaborative Mapping?
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit the same map simultaneously
- **Auto-saving**: All changes are automatically saved and synced
- **Conflict Prevention**: Layer blocking prevents race conditions
- **Low Latency**: Changes appear to other users almost instantly

### Collaboration Features
- **Live Cursors**: See where other users are working
- **Change Indicators**: Visual indicators show recent changes
- **User Presence**: See who is currently viewing the map
- **Edit History**: Track who made what changes

## Step 2: Share Your Map for Collaboration

### Enable Collaboration
1. **Open Your Map**: Navigate to the map you want to share
2. **Click Share**: Look for the share button in the top toolbar
3. **Set Permissions**: Choose collaboration settings
4. **Invite Team Members**: Add users to your team

### Permission Levels
- **View Only**: Users can view but not edit
- **Edit**: Users can make changes to the map
- **Admin**: Users can manage the map and permissions
- **Owner**: Full control over the map

## Step 3: Real-time Editing

### Start Editing
1. **Select Layer**: Click on a layer you want to edit
2. **Enter Edit Mode**: Click the edit button or press E
3. **Make Changes**: Edit features, add new ones, or modify attributes
4. **Save Changes**: Changes are automatically saved

### Visual Feedback
- **Edit Cursor**: Your cursor shows as an edit icon
- **Other Users**: See cursors of other users working on the map
- **Change Highlights**: Recent changes are highlighted briefly
- **Status Indicators**: Shows when layers are being edited

## Step 4: Layer Blocking System

### How Layer Blocking Works
- **Automatic Blocking**: When you start editing a layer, it's blocked for others
- **Visual Indicator**: Blocked layers show a lock icon
- **User Information**: See who is currently editing each layer
- **Auto-release**: Layers are automatically released when editing stops

### Layer Blocking Behavior
1. **Start Editing**: Layer becomes blocked for other users
2. **Edit Session**: Only you can modify the layer
3. **Save Changes**: Changes are saved and synced
4. **Release Layer**: Layer becomes available for others

## Step 5: Collaborative Features

### Live Cursors
- **User Cursors**: See where other team members are working
- **User Names**: Cursors show user names or initials
- **Activity Indicators**: Different cursor styles for different activities
- **Real-time Updates**: Cursor positions update in real-time

### Change Notifications
- **Change Alerts**: Get notified when others make changes
- **Change History**: View recent changes in the activity panel
- **User Attribution**: See who made each change
- **Change Details**: View specific details about changes

### Chat and Comments
- **In-map Chat**: Chat with team members while working
- **Layer Comments**: Add comments to specific layers
- **Feature Comments**: Comment on individual features
- **Discussion Threads**: Organize discussions by topic

## Step 6: Managing Collaborative Sessions

### User Management
1. **View Active Users**: See who is currently in the map
2. **User Status**: Check if users are viewing or editing
3. **Invite Users**: Add new team members to the session
4. **Remove Users**: Remove users if needed

### Session Controls
- **Pause Collaboration**: Temporarily disable editing for others
- **Lock Map**: Prevent any changes while you work
- **End Session**: Close the collaborative session
- **Export Changes**: Save a snapshot of current state

### Conflict Resolution
- **Automatic Resolution**: Most conflicts are resolved automatically
- **Manual Resolution**: Review and resolve conflicts manually
- **Change Merging**: Merge conflicting changes intelligently
- **Version History**: Access previous versions if needed

## Step 7: Best Practices for Collaboration

### Communication
- **Coordinate Edits**: Communicate with team members about what you're editing
- **Use Comments**: Add comments to explain your changes
- **Regular Updates**: Keep team informed about major changes
- **Documentation**: Document collaborative workflows

### Workflow Optimization
- **Divide Work**: Assign different layers to different team members
- **Batch Edits**: Make multiple related changes together
- **Review Changes**: Regularly review changes made by others
- **Backup Strategy**: Maintain backups of important collaborative work

### Performance Tips
- **Limit Simultaneous Users**: Avoid too many users editing simultaneously
- **Optimize Data**: Use optimized data formats for better performance
- **Regular Saves**: Encourage team members to save regularly
- **Monitor Activity**: Keep an eye on collaborative activity

## Step 8: Troubleshooting Collaboration Issues

### Common Issues
- **Layer Won't Unlock**: Try refreshing the page or contacting the user
- **Changes Not Syncing**: Check your internet connection
- **Performance Issues**: Reduce the number of simultaneous editors
- **Conflicts**: Review and resolve conflicts manually

### Solutions
- **Refresh Page**: Often resolves sync issues
- **Check Permissions**: Ensure you have proper editing permissions
- **Contact Team**: Communicate with team members about issues
- **Support**: Contact support for persistent issues

### Prevention
- **Regular Communication**: Keep team informed about your work
- **Proper Permissions**: Set appropriate permission levels
- **Data Validation**: Validate data before collaborative editing
- **Backup Strategy**: Maintain regular backups

## Step 9: Advanced Collaboration Features

### Version Control
- **Change History**: View complete history of changes
- **Revert Changes**: Revert to previous versions if needed
- **Compare Versions**: Compare different versions of the map
- **Branching**: Create branches for experimental work

### Workflow Integration
- **Task Assignment**: Assign specific tasks to team members
- **Progress Tracking**: Track progress on collaborative projects
- **Quality Control**: Implement review processes for changes
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive collaborative tasks

### Analytics and Reporting
- **Collaboration Metrics**: Track collaboration activity
