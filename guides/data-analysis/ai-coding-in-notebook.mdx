## Step 2: Error Resolution with GAIA

### "Resolve in GAIA" Button
When code encounters errors:
1. **Error Occurs**: Code execution fails with detailed error message
2. **Click "Resolve in GAIA"**: Click the blue button in the error output
3. **AI Agent Activation**: Nika's AI agent analyzes the entire notebook context
4. **Comprehensive Analysis**: AI looks at the bigger picture, not just the error

### GAIA's Analysis
- **Full Context**: Analyzes entire notebook, not just the error line
- **Dependency Tracking**: Understands library imports and dependencies
- **Data Flow**: Tracks how data flows through your analysis
- **Best Practices**: Suggests improvements based on coding standards
