## GDAL and CUDA Installation

GDAL and CUDA are pre-installed on all ephemeral VM kernels that your notebooks have direct access to. No manual installation required.

## Pre-Installed Software

### Available Configurations
All VM kernels come with:
- **GDAL 3.9.1**: Geospatial Data Abstraction Library for raster and vector data
- **CUDA 12.2**: NVIDIA CUDA for GPU acceleration
- **Python 3.10/3.11**: Multiple Python versions available

### Kernel Selection
When starting your machine, you can choose from:
- **Python 3.10, GDAL 3.9.1 CUDA 12.2**
- **Python 3.11, GDAL 3.9.1 CUDA 12.2**
- **Python 3.10, GDAL 3.9.1 CUDA 12**

## Ready to Use

### No Installation Required
- **Pre-configured**: All geospatial libraries are ready to use
- **GPU Ready**: CUDA drivers and libraries are installed
- **Immediate Access**: Start analyzing geospatial data right away

### Direct Access
- **Workspace Integration**: Direct access to workspace files
- **Large Dataset Support**: Optimized for TB-PB sized geospatial data
- **Performance Optimized**: GPU acceleration for raster processing

## Usage Examples

### GDAL Operations
```python
import rasterio
import geopandas as gpd

# Read raster data
with rasterio.open('/workspace/data/satellite.tif') as src:
    data = src.read()

# Read vector data
gdf = gpd.read_file('/workspace/data/shapefile.shp')
```

### CUDA Acceleration
```python
import cupy as cp
import numpy as np

# GPU-accelerated array operations
gpu_array = cp.array(np.random.random((1000, 1000)))
result = cp.linalg.svd(gpu_array)
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have GDAL and CUDA ready:

1. **Start Analysis**: Begin your geospatial analysis immediately
2. **Load Data**: Access your workspace data files
3. **Use GPU**: Leverage CUDA for accelerated processing
4. **Scale Up**: Work with large geospatial datasets efficiently
