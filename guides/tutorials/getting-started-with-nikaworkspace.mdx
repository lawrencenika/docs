## Getting Started with NikaWorkspace

Welcome to Nika! This guide will help you get familiar with the platform and start your first project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- **Nika Account**: Sign up at [https://planet.nika.eco](https://planet.nika.eco)
- **Onboarding**: Book and complete your [onboarding call](https://cal.com/dianaong/30-minute-consultation) to get trial access

## Step 1: Manage Data Workspaces

1. **Project**: Each of your workspaces is a logical separation for project management, to keep your resources such as file storage, notebooks, maps and databases separate.
2. **Login**: Visit [https://planet.nika.eco](https://planet.nika.eco) and sign in
3. **Dashboard**: You'll see your main dashboard with access to a default workspace if you log in for the first time
4. **Navigation**: Click on the default workspace to open, use the left sidebar to navigate between different tools

## Step 2: Explore the Interface

### Main Components
- **Left Sidebar**: Navigation between Nika products
- **Top Bar**: User settings, notifications, and help
- **Main Area**: Content area that changes based on selected tool
- **Right Panel**: Context-sensitive tools and options

### Available Tools in Nika
- **Nika Notebooks**: Data analysis, notebooks and VM
- **Nika Map**: Interactive map visualization
- **Nika Studio**: Application development
- **Publish to Nika Hub**: Community and team internal sharing
- **Nika Labeller**: Image annotation
- **Nika ETL**: Data processing pipelines
- **Nika Database Engine**: Intergration with your existing databases or one click creation of Nika managed DuckDB instance
- **Nika GAIA**: Nika's AI Agent for coding and mapping

### Create a New Map 
1. **Click Map** icon in the left sidebar
2. **Click "+"** button to create new map
3. **Drag files** from the files list in left sidebar to add as layer to the open map. Note: drop to the center of the map to trigger `Add to Map` instead of opening file

### Create a New Notebook
1. **Click Notebook** icon in the left sidebar
2. **Click "+"** button to create new notebook
3. **Click Machine** icon at bottom left to then start the machine
4. **Run code in your notebook** by following this [guide](/guides/data-analysis/run-code-in-notebook)

## Step 3: Upload Your First Data

### Upload Files
1. **Click "Files"** in the left sidebar
2. **Click "Upload"** button and select your files from desktop
3. **Drag and Drop** alternaitvely, drag multiple files and drop them on the file list when left sidebar is open

### Design of Nika File Storage
- **Size Limit**: Theoretically Nika Cloud FS can host up to 100s of TB size per workspace
- **Integration**: These files are natively accessible in your notebook code through secure connection, and adding them as layer to map is as easy as drag and drop on map
- **Editor**: For certain formats like .py, .json, .js, you can double click to open the file in Nika web UI and edit them directly
- **Machine Learning**: If you are try to train machine learning models over a large groups of test/train/eval split datasets, Nika FS is the best option as your machine learning code in notebook work immediately on files
