## Overview

Nika is a web-based geospatial platform built to solve real-world problems we encountered as active users of ArcGIS, QGIS, and Google Earth Engine. Understanding our journey and core concepts will help you make the most of Nika's capabilities.

## Our Story

### The Problem We Solved
As active users of ArcGIS, QGIS, and Google Earth Engine for Land Use Land Cover (LULC) analysis, we found ourselves limited by the flexibility of these tools when we wanted to use as many open-source libraries as possible for our analysis.

### The Solution We Built
1. **Hosted Notebook Environment**: We built our own hosted notebook environment to use any open-source library we wanted
2. **Kubernetes Infrastructure**: Instead of expensive 24/7 EC2 instances, we chose Kubernetes clusters on-demand (like Colab, but much more powerful)
3. **AI-Powered Development**: When clients needed quick map apps to showcase analysis results, we built NikaStudio using Agentic AI to build any app they wanted
4. **Continuous Innovation**: We're constantly building more features and products

## Core Architecture

### Six-Product Ecosystem

Nika consists of six main products that work together seamlessly:

#### NikaWorkspace
Advanced geospatial data analysis platform with petabyte-scale datasets and AI agent integration.

#### NikaStudio
AI-powered application development platform for building maps and dashboards with brilliant UI and automated serverless backend.

#### NikaMap
World's first collaborative auto-saving map that can visualize millions of vector polygons, GBs of raster images, and drone imagery.

#### NikaGallery
Community platform for discovering, sharing, and showcasing geospatial applications and solutions.

#### NikaLabeller
Image annotation platform with team labeling capabilities and native GeoTIFF support.

#### NikaETL
