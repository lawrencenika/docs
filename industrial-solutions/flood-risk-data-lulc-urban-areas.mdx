# Flood Risk Data LULC In Urban Areas

![Flood Risk Data LULC In Urban Areas](/industrial-solutions/flood-risk-data-lulc-urban-areas-1.jpeg)

This script prepares core geospatial layers for analyzing flood-prone areas in Bangkok. It exports elevation, land cover (water and built-up areas), and October 2023 rainfall data to local GeoTIFF files using Google Earth Engine and geemap. The outputs are used for flood vulnerability analysis, especially in low-lying, urbanized zones.

## Output File
`/data/bangkok_flood_native`

## Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Software** | Python 3.x, Earth Engine Python API, geemap |
| **Earth Engine** | Enabled Google Earth Engine account (https://signup.earthengine.google.com) |
| **Python Packages** | geemap, earthengine-api, os, ee |
| **Internet** | Required for Earth Engine data download |

## Files Created

| Filename | Description | Resolution |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **dem_srtm.tif** | Elevation data from SRTM (clipped to AOI) | 30 m |
| **dw_water_built_mask.tif** | Masked Dynamic World image (1=Water, 2=Built) | 10 m |
| **rainfall_oct2023_chirps.tif** | CHIRPS total rainfall for Oct 2023 | ~5.5 km |

## High-Level Workflow Steps

### 1. Setup and Define AOI
Define Bangkok's location and buffer by 10 km to create an Area of Interest (AOI).

### 2. Export SRTM Elevation
- Use the **USGS/SRTMGL1_003** dataset
- Export as `dem_srtm.tif` at 30 m resolution

### 3. Export Landcover (Water & Built)
- Use the **Google Dynamic World** dataset for 2023
- Use `.mode()` to get the most frequent class
- Remap values: 0 â†’ Water (1), 6 â†’ Built (2), others â†’ 0
- Export as `dw_water_built_mask.tif` at 10 m resolution

### 4. Export Rainfall
- Use **CHIRPS Daily** rainfall dataset
- Sum rainfall for October 2023
- Export as `rainfall_oct2023_chirps.tif` at ~5.5 km resolution

## Flood Risk Classification

This script generates a flood risk classification map of Bangkok using:

- **SRTM DEM (Elevation at 30m)** to identify low-lying areas (&lt; 5 meters elevation)
- **Dynamic World Landcover (10m)** to locate built-up and water regions

### Output: Flood-Prone Map
You get a matplotlib map showing flood-prone areas based on both elevation and landcover:

#### Legend Explained

| Color | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| ðŸ”µ **Blue** | Low-lying Water | Areas classified as water in DW and below 5 meters elevation |
| ðŸ”´ **Red** | Low-lying Built-up | Areas classified as built-up and below 5 meters elevation |
