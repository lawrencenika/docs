# River Urbanisation With Major Cities Comparisons

![River Urbanisation With Major Cities Comparisons](/industrial-solutions/river-urbanisation-major-cities-comparisons-1.jpeg)

## River Basin Urban Development Analyzer

Processes satellite imagery (built-up, water, NDVI) to analyze urban development patterns across multiple regions, generating statistical summaries, comparison plots, and detailed land use classifications.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Software** | Python 3.x, rasterio, matplotlib, pandas, numpy |
| **Data Sources** | Pre-downloaded satellite imagery (Built-up, Water, NDVI, Satellite) |
| **Python Packages** | rasterio, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas, shapely, pathlib |

## Input Data

TIF files for each region: `*_buildup.tif`, `*_water.tif`, `*_ndvi.tif`, `*_satellite.tif`

## Files Created

| Filename | Description | Format |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **region_summary.csv** | Statistical summary for all analyzed regions | CSV |
| **comparison_analysis.png** | 4-panel comparison plots across all regions | PNG (300 DPI) |
| **{region}_detailed_analysis.png** | Detailed 4-panel analysis for each region | PNG (300 DPI) |
| **analysis_report.md** | Comprehensive markdown report with insights | Markdown |

## High-Level Workflow Steps

### 1. Region Discovery & Data Loading
Auto-discover regions from `*_buildup.tif` files in data directory

Load corresponding water, NDVI, and satellite imagery for each region

Handle nodata values and coordinate transformations

### 2. Statistical Analysis
Calculate built-up area coverage and intensity (hectares & percentages)

Analyze water occurrence (permanent vs seasonal water bodies)

Compute vegetation indices (NDVI-based green cover analysis)

Generate composite land use statistics

### 3. Urban Classification
- **Dense Urban**: >50% built-up coverage
- **Moderate Urban**: 25-50% built-up coverage
- **Low Urban**: 10-25% built-up coverage
- **Rural/Natural**: &lt;10% built-up coverage

### 4. Visualization Generation
**Comparison Plots**: 4-panel matplotlib figure with scatter plots, bar charts, and pie charts

**Regional Details**: Individual 4-panel analysis showing built-up, water, NDVI, and land use classification

**Static PNG Output**: High-resolution images suitable for reports and publications

### 5. Report Generation
Regional rankings (most urbanized, highest water coverage, most vegetated)

Key insights and development patterns

Comprehensive data tables with all calculated metrics

## Output Analysis Capabilities

This script generates comprehensive urban development assessment using:

- **Built-up Intensity Maps** - Identifies urban development patterns and density
- **Water Occurrence Analysis** - Distinguishes permanent vs seasonal water bodies
- **Vegetation Health (NDVI)** - Maps green cover and vegetation density
- **Land Use Classification** - Composite analysis of urban, water, vegetation, and other land uses

## Visualization Outputs

### Comparison Analysis (4-Panel Plot)
- **Built-up vs Water Coverage Scatter** - Shows relationship between urbanization and water presence (colored by NDVI)
- **Vegetation Distribution Bar Chart** - Compares green cover across all regions
- **Urban Development Intensity** - Color-coded by urban classification (Dense/Moderate/Low/Rural)
- **Average Land Use Pie Chart** - Overall composition of built-up, water, vegetation, and other land uses

### Detailed Regional Analysis (Per Region)
- **Built-up Areas Map** - Red intensity showing urban development density
- **Water Occurrence Map** - Blue gradient showing water body frequency (0-100%)
- **Vegetation Index (NDVI)** - Green-red gradient showing vegetation health (-0.2 to 0.8)
- **Land Use Classification** - Categorical map (Urban=Red, Water=Blue, Vegetation=Green, Other=Black)

## Key Metrics Calculated

| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| **Built-up** | Mean intensity, max intensity, total area (ha), high-density area (ha), percentage coverage |
| **Water** | Mean occurrence, permanent water area (>80%), seasonal water area (20-80%), percentage coverage |
| **Vegetation** | Mean NDVI, vegetation area (>0.3), dense vegetation (>0.5), bare soil area, percentage coverage |
| **Composite** | Total area, urban classification, development patterns, land use ratios |

## Analysis Insights Generated

- **Urban Pressure Assessment** - Identifies regions with high development pressure
- **Water Resource Mapping** - Quantifies permanent vs seasonal water availability
- **Green Space Evaluation** - Measures vegetation cover and ecological health
- **Development Patterns** - Reveals relationships between urbanization and environmental factors

## Result

Multi-scale urban development analysis with both regional comparisons and detailed local assessments for sustainable planning and environmental monitoring.

## Output

### Quick Summary
